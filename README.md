# @JTweenr MMR Calculator
### Ranked-Play MMR Algorithm plus TestBench designed for Call of Duty: World War II

This algorithm was written in python3 for simplicity's sake. It is composed entirely of floating point math and can be easily translated to another programming language.

The algorithm is provided with a fully-functional TestBench for debugging and tweaking. To test the algorithm, input data from a match into the `Data Input Block` section of code, and run as-is. To tweak, adjust values in the `Customization Block` section of code and run as-is. Editing other parts of the code will generally produce unintended effects.
